# udacity-sleep-tracker

This is the sixth app for lesson 6 and 7 of the [Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012).

This app is not my own, but the team that developed the course.

# How this repository is organized

Once the same Project was used for two lessons, I created following two branchs:

[ROOM](https://github.com/fernandohbrasil/udacity-sleep-tracker/tree/ROOM) - With the lesson 6

[RecyclerView](https://github.com/fernandohbrasil/udacity-sleep-tracker/tree/RecyclerView) - With the lesson 7
